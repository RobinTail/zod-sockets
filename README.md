Socket.IO Websockets with Zod validation.

Experimental solution for testing purposes only.

## Concept

The library distinguishes between incoming and outgoing events. The first are called Actions, and the second â€” Emission.
Emission is configured first, representing the schemas for validating the outgoing data, as well as optionally received
acknowledgements. Based on this configuration, an Actions Factory is created, where Actions are produced that have
schemas for checking the incoming data and an optionally sent acknowledgement, and a handler. This handler is aware of
the Emission types and is equipped with the emission and broadcasting methods, while its returns become an
acknowledgement for the Action. This configuration is used to validate the input and output data against the specified
schemas, thus ensuring that the established contract is followed.

# Quick start

## Installation

Install the package and its peer dependencies.

```shell
yarn add zod-sockets zod socket.io
```

## Set up config

```typescript
import { createConfig } from "zod-sockets";

const config = createConfig({
  timeout: 2000,
  emission: {},
  logger: console,
});
```

## Create a factory

```typescript
import { ActionsFactory } from "zod-sockets";

const actionsFactory = new ActionsFactory(config);
```

## Create an action

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const onPing = actionsFactory.build({
  input: z.tuple([]).rest(z.unknown()),
  output: z.tuple([z.literal("pong")]).rest(z.unknown()),
  handler: async ({ input }) => ["pong", ...input] as const,
});
```

## Create a server

```typescript
import http from "node:http";
import { Server } from "socket.io";
import { attachSockets } from "zod-sockets";

attachSockets({
  /** @see https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-options/ */
  io: new Server(),
  config: config,
  actions: { ping: onPing },
  target: http.createServer().listen(8090),
});
```

## Try it

Start the application and execute the following [command](https://socket.io/docs/v4/troubleshooting-connection-issues/):

```shell
curl "http://localhost:8090/socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling"
```

The expected response should be similar to:

```json
{
  "sid": "***",
  "upgrades": ["websocket"],
  "pingInterval": 25000,
  "pingTimeout": 20000,
  "maxPayload": 1000000
}
```

Then consider using [Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/websocket/create-a-socketio-request/)
for sending the `ping` event to `ws://localhost:8090` with acknowledgement.

# Basic features

## Emission

The outgoing events should be configured using `z.tuple()` schemas. Those tuples describe the types of the arguments
supplied to the `Socket::emit()` method, excluding an optional acknowledgment, which has its own optional schema being
a callback function having ordered arguments. The schemas may also have transformations. This declaration establishes
the constraints on your further implementation as well as payload validation and helps to avoid mistakes during the
development. Consider the following examples of two outgoing events, with and without acknowledgment:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { createConfig } from "zod-sockets";

const config = createConfig({
  emission: {
    // enabling Socket::emit("chat", "message", { from: "someone" })
    chat: {
      schema: z.tuple([z.string(), z.object({ from: z.string() })]),
    },
    // enabling Socket::emit("secret", "message", ([readAt]: [Date]) => {})
    secret: {
      schema: z.tuple([z.string()]),
      ack: z.tuple([
        z
          .string()
          .datetime()
          .transform((str) => new Date(str)),
      ]),
    },
  },
});
```

## Receiving events

### Making actions

Actions (the declarations of incoming events) are produced on an `ActionFactory` which is an entity made aware of the
Emission types (possible outgoing events) by supplying the config to its constructor. This architecture enables you to
keep the produced Actions in separate self-descriptive files.

```typescript
import { ActionsFactory } from "zod-sockets";

const actionsFactory = new ActionsFactory(config);
```

The Emission awareness of the `ActionsFactory` enables you to emit and broadcast other events due to receiving the
incoming event. This should not be confused with acknowledgments that are basically direct and immediate responses to
the one that sent the incoming event. Produce actions using the `build()` method accepting an object having `input`
schema for the event payload (excluding acknowledgment) and a `handler`, which is a function where you place your
implementation for handling the event. Please note that the incoming event name is not assigned yet. The argument of
the `handler` in an object having several handy entities, the most important of them is `input` property, being the
validated event payload:

```typescript
const onChat = actionsFactory.build({
  input: z.tuple([z.string()]),
  handler: async ({ input: [message], client, all, withRooms, logger }) => {
    /* your implementation here */
    // typeof message === "string"
  },
});
```

### Acknowledgements

Actions may also have an acknowledgement, which is acquired from the returns of the `handler` and being validated
against additionally specified `output` schema. When the number of payload arguments is flexible, you can use `rest()`
method of `z.tuple()`. When the data type is not important at all, consider describing it using `z.unknown()`.
When using `z.literal()`, Typescript may assume the type of the actually returned value more loose, therefore the
`as const` expression might be required. The following example illustrates an action acknowledging "ping" event with
"pong" and an echo of the received payload:

```typescript
const onPing = actionsFactory.build({
  input: z.tuple([]).rest(z.unknown()),
  output: z.tuple([z.literal("pong")]).rest(z.unknown()),
  handler: async ({ input }) => ["pong" as const, ...input],
});
```

### Action Map

Independently declared Actions should be assigned to the incoming event names within a structure called `ActionMap`.
That implies that in some cases you can reuse an Action for assigning it to different event names. Consider this as a
router for the incoming events.

```typescript
import { ActionMap } from "zod-sockets";

const actions: ActionMap = {
  chat: onChat,
  ping: onPing,
};
```

# Dispatching events

## In Action context

Depending on your application's needs and architecture, you can choose different ways to send events. The emission
methods have constraints on emission types declared in the configuration. The `input` is available for processing the
validated payload of the Action.

```typescript
actionsFactory.build({
  handler: async ({ input, client, withRooms, getAllRooms, all }) => {
    // sending to the sender of the received event:
    await client.emit("event", ...payload);
    // sending to everyone except the client:
    await client.broadcast("event", ...payload);
    // sending to everyone except the client in a room:
    withRooms("room1").broadcast("event", ...payload);
    // sending to everyone except the client within several rooms:
    withRooms(["room1", "room2"]).broadcast("event", ...payload);
    // sending to everyone everywhere including the client:
    all.broadcast("event", ...payload);
  },
});
```

## In Client context

The previous example illustrated the events dispatching due to or in a context of an incoming event. But you can also
emit events regardless the incoming ones by setting the `onConnection` property of the `attachSockets()` argument,
which has a similar interface except `input` and fires for every connected client:

```typescript
attachSockets({
  onConnection: async ({ client, withRooms, getAllRooms }) => {
    /* your implementation here */
  },
});
```

## Independent context

Moreover, you can emit events regardless the client activity at all by setting the `onStartup` property of the
`attachSockets()` argument. The implementation may have a `setInterval()` for recurring emission.

```typescript
attachSockets({
  onStartup: async ({ all, withRooms }) => {
    // sending to everyone in a room
    withRooms("room1").broadcast("event", ...payload);
    // sending to everyone within several rooms:
    withRooms(["room1", "room2"]).broadcast("event", ...payload);
    // sending to everyone everywhere
    all.broadcast("event", ...payload);
  },
});
```
